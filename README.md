# Kaggle - Digit Recognizer

 Computer vision techniques to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

# DATA PREPROCESSING

 • Load Data
 • Check for null/missing values
 • Check for unbalanced labels
 • Data normalization
 • Label encoding (One Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables to one hot vectors)
 • Split training and validation sets
 
# TRAINING MODELS

 • Multiple Linear Regression
 • Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 • Optimized distributed Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with parameter tuning
 • Random Forest Classifier
 • K Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 
# EVALUATING MODELS
 
 Evaluation performed based on both the F1 score and the deduced accuracy of each model on the validation data.
