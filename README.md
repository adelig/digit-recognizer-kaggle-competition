# Kaggle - Digit Recognizer

 Computer vision techniques to identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

# DATA PREPROCESSING

 • Load Data <br />
 • Check for null/missing values <br />
 • Check for unbalanced labels <br />
 • Data normalization <br />
 • Label encoding (One Hot Encoding to convert categorical variables to one hot vectors) <br />
 • Split training and validation sets <br />
 
# TRAINING MODELS

 • Multiple Linear Regression <br />
 • Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <br />
 • Optimized distributed Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with parameter tuning <br />
 • Random Forest Classifier <br />
 • K Nearest Neighbors Classifier (KNN) with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) <br />
 
# EVALUATING MODELS
 
 Evaluation performed based on both the F1 score and the deduced accuracy of each model on the validation data.
